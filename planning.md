Pseudocode for the overall gameplay:

create 4 total elements with different color values
randomly select a value to blink
await for blink to complete
store that value in an array
take useer input (dependent on value(color) of clickable square containers)
store user input in array and compare to computer array
if equal append new value to array and blink squares accordingly
use javascript async functions to blink next square a set intrval(setTimeout) after first square blinks and etc
await for sequence to finish THEN =>
take user input and compare to computer stored array
continue game loop;
